# Hi! This site was created as a technical test for the Junior React Develoepr position at Фабрика Приложений Company

To launch the app, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
3. Once the server has started, the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Thank you!
